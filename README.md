# ILMAC-App
Beacon App for ILMAC Philadelphia Sacrifice, Honor and Freedom Walking Tour
Purpose
ILMAC maintains the land abutting and covering I-95 through Philadelphia Center City including memorials and park space.  ILMAC is considering a beacon technology solution to enhance and expand visitors’ experiences to historical sites and memorials in this area of Philadelphia.
An opportunity exists to engineer the the beacon solution to better reflect the mission of ILMAC and incorporate the latest web and interactive app technology.
Upon completion of the development of the beacon system, ILMAC will assume full responsibility for content maintenance and administration. All content, coding and graphics will become the sole property of ILMAC.
Description
Create a flexible, informative beacon proximity solution that is easy to maintain. We must develop a intuitive, attractive mobile device app that can deliver relevant and regularly changing information to our key audiences. In addition to designing a user-friendly app with an intuitive interface, we must also develop a web-based, database-driven administration tool that allows key management personnel to easily update content with no or minimal access to source code.
Ultimate editorial control of content will be driven by each specific site committee or board of directors through access to an umbrella coding structure that facilitates publishing new information on a location by location basis through a browser-based user interface.
To be effective, our beacon and mobile device app solution must be:
Easy and intuitive to use
Visually pleasing
Informative
Safe and secure
Quick to load and operate
